### The project management, invoicing, team collaboration tool to rule them all!

There are a lot of great invoicing, project management, and team collaboration tools on the market today. The problem is all three of those things are usually handled in two to three different tools. What if one piece of software could effectively manage all aspects of project management, accounting, team management, client management, and sales force management? Mana plans to bring all those small pieces into one easy to use application that every employee in any role within a team will enjoy.

This is a product being built by the Assembly community. You can help push this idea forward by visiting [https://assembly.com/mana](https://assembly.com/mana).

### How Assembly Works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.
